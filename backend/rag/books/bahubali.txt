Baahubali: The Full Detailed Story – A Scene-by-Scene Epic Narrative
Baahubali (translating to "The One with Strong Arms") is a two-part Indian epic fantasy film series directed by S.S. Rajamouli, released in Telugu (with dubs in other languages) in 2015 (Baahubali: The Beginning) and 2017 (Baahubali: The Conclusion). Produced by Arka Media Works, it stars Prabhas in dual roles as Amarendra Baahubali and his son Mahendra Baahubali (Sivudu/Shivudu), alongside Rana Daggubati as the antagonist Bhallaladeva, Anushka Shetty as Devasena, Tamannaah Bhatia as Avantika, Ramya Krishnan as Sivagami, Sathyaraj as Kattappa, and Nassar as Bijjaladeva. The story is a grand tale of royalty, betrayal, love, war, and redemption set in the fictional kingdom of Mahishmati. It draws inspiration from Indian mythology and epics like the Mahabharata, blending high-stakes drama, massive battles, innovative VFX (like the waterfall climb and statue erection), and emotional twists.
The narrative unfolds across two films, with the first building mystery around a cliffhanger ("Why did Kattappa kill Baahubali?") and the second revealing twists through flashbacks. Below is a full detailed, scene-by-scene breakdown of the entire story, including key actions, character developments, twists, visual spectacles, and famous original Telugu dialogues (with English translations). I've integrated dialogues contextually where they appear in the films, based on iconic lines from the Telugu version.
Part 1: Baahubali – The Beginning (Setting the Stage for Mystery and Heroism)
Opening Credits and Prologue (The Waterfall Miracle):
The film opens with breathtaking visuals of a massive waterfall cascading down a mountain. A wounded woman, Sivagami (Ramya Krishnan), emerges from a cave, clutching an infant. She's fleeing pursuers in a stormy night. As she wades through raging waters, she prays to Lord Shiva: Original Telugu Dialogue: "Shiva! Ee baluni kaapaadu... Mahendra Baahubali ni kaapaadu!" (English: "Shiva! Protect this child... Protect Mahendra Baahubali!"). Swept away, she holds the baby aloft with one hand, sacrificing herself. The infant is rescued by villagers from the Amburi tribe below the falls. Sanga (Rohini), the chieftain's wife, adopts him, naming him Sivudu (Prabhas). This scene sets the epic tone with themes of sacrifice and destiny, using stunning CGI for the floods and waterfall.
Sivudu's Childhood and Superhuman Feats:
Years later, Sivudu grows into a strong, curious young man obsessed with climbing the unclimbable waterfall to see what's above. He displays god-like strength: lifting heavy rocks, taming wild animals, and even uprooting a massive Shiva Lingam to place it under the falls for easier worship. Sanga tries to stop him, but his determination shines. One day, a wooden mask falls from the top, belonging to a beautiful warrior woman. Sivudu imagines her and vows to climb up. Twist Element: His feats hint at his royal bloodline, unknown to him.
The Climb and Meeting Avantika:
Sivudu scales the sheer cliff using vines, arrows, and sheer will (iconic slow-motion sequences). At the top, he enters a lush forest and encounters Avantika (Tamannaah Bhatia), a fierce rebel warrior from a resistance group fighting the tyrant king of Mahishmati. She's tattooing her arm when Sivudu sneaks up and completes the tattoo with his own design. Initially furious, Avantika chases him in a high-octane fight-dance sequence. Sivudu woos her with charm and strength, and they fall in love during a romantic song ("Dheevara"). Avantika reveals her mission: to rescue Queen Devasena (Anushka Shetty), imprisoned for 25 years by King Bhallaladeva (Rana Daggubati).
Infiltration of Mahishmati and the Statue Erection:
Sivudu disguises himself as a fool to enter Mahishmati during Bhallaladeva's birthday celebrations. The kingdom is opulent but oppressive, with slaves erecting a gigantic golden statue of Bhallaladeva. When the statue topples toward the crowd, Sivudu single-handedly holds it up with ropes and muscles, saving lives. The slaves and people chant "Baahubali!" (referring to the legendary prince), enraging Bhallaladeva. This scene showcases massive sets and VFX, emphasizing class divide. Famous Telugu Dialogue (from slaves): "Baahubali! Baahubali!" (English: Chanting the name, symbolizing hope).
Rescuing Devasena and the Chase:
That night, Sivudu sneaks into the palace, frees Devasena from her chains, and escapes with her on his back. Devasena, fierce despite years of captivity, fights guards. Bhallaladeva's son Bhadra (Adivi Sesh) and loyal slave Kattappa (Sathyaraj) pursue them. In a forest ambush, Bhadra tortures Devasena, but Sivudu breaks free, beheads Bhadra in a brutal fight, and defeats the pursuers. The Amburi tribe arrives to help. Kattappa, seeing Sivudu's face, kneels and calls him "Baahubali." Major Twist: Kattappa reveals Sivudu is Mahendra Baahubali, son of the great Amarendra Baahubali. He begins the flashback.
Flashback Begins: The Throne Succession:
25 years earlier, King Vikramadeva dies, leaving Mahishmati in chaos. Sivagami, wife of the disabled prince Bijjaladeva (Nassar), takes charge. Bijjaladeva, power-hungry and manipulative, wants his son Bhallaladeva as king. Sivagami adopts orphan Amarendra Baahubali (Prabhas) and raises both boys equally, promising the throne to the worthier one. The boys train as warriors: Baahubali is compassionate, Bhallaladeva ruthless.
The Kalakeya War – Epic Battle Sequence:
The barbaric Kalakeya tribe, led by Inkoshi (Prabhakar), invades with savage weapons. Sivagami declares: whoever kills Inkoshi becomes king. In a massive war (one of cinema's largest battle scenes with 2000 extras and CGI), Baahubali uses clever tactics like fire arrows and shields, saving civilians. Bhallaladeva charges brutally, killing indiscriminately. Baahubali slays Inkoshi heroically. Famous Telugu Dialogue (Kalakeya language invented for the film, by Sivagami): "Kalakeyalu... Mahishmati ki raaru!" (English: "The Kalakeyas... shall not enter Mahishmati!"). Sivagami crowns Baahubali heir for his humanity, making Bhallaladeva commander. Twist Element: Jealousy brews in Bhallaladeva and Bijjaladeva.
Cliffhanger Ending:
As the flashback pauses, Sivudu demands why Baahubali was killed. Kattappa confesses: Iconic Telugu Dialogue: "Baahubali ni champindi nene!" (English: "I am the one who killed Baahubali!"). The film ends on this shocking twist, leaving audiences hooked.
Part 2: Baahubali – The Conclusion (Revelations, Betrayals, and Vengeance)
Resuming the Flashback: Baahubali's Tour and Romance:
Kattappa narrates: Sivagami sends Baahubali on a kingdom tour in disguise to understand the people. With Kattappa, he visits Kuntala kingdom, where he sees Princess Devasena defending against bandits. Disguised as a commoner, Baahubali joins her court, teaching her cousin Kumara Varma (Subbaraju) swordsmanship. Romance blossoms in songs like "Saahore Baahubali." Famous Telugu Dialogue (Baahubali to Devasena): "Nee cheyi vesina chotulo, naa jeevitham undi!" (English: "In the place where you lay your hand, my life resides!").
Bhallaladeva's Jealousy and Marriage Plot:
Back in Mahishmati, Bhallaladeva lusts after Devasena's portrait. Sivagami proposes marriage, but Devasena rejects it boldly: Famous Telugu Dialogue: "Nenu em chesina, adhi nijam ga chesina... Nee lanti vaadini nenu cheyyali anukonu!" (English: "Whatever I do, I do truthfully... I wouldn't even consider someone like you!"). Bijjaladeva manipulates Sivagami to order Baahubali to capture Devasena as a prisoner.
Kuntala Palace Attack and Identity Reveal:
Pindari bandits attack Kuntala. Baahubali, Kattappa, Devasena, and Kumara Varma repel them in an elaborate sequence with fire, horses, and archery. Kattappa reveals Baahubali's identity. Baahubali proposes, and Devasena accepts. They return to Mahishmati for marriage, but Sivagami, misled, demotes Baahubali, crowning Bhallaladeva king. Twist: Sivagami's manipulation by Bijjaladeva.
Pregnancy, Demotion, and Exile:
Devasena, pregnant, challenges Bhallaladeva's tyranny. He appoints Sethupathi (Rakesh Varre) as commander, demoting Baahubali. When Sethupathi insults Devasena (cutting her saree), Baahubali kills him: Famous Telugu Dialogue: "Stree la pi aakraamani chese vaadini... Vellu kaadu, gala kaapu!" (English: "Those who misbehave with women, you should cut not their fingers, but their throat!"). Sivagami exiles them.
The Ultimate Betrayal and Assassination:
Bhallaladeva fears Baahubali's popularity. Bijjaladeva tricks Kumara Varma into assassinating Bhallaladeva (faking a threat to Devasena). The plot fails, and Sivagami, deceived, orders Kattappa to kill Baahubali. Kattappa, bound by oath, stabs him in the back during a hunt. Major Twist: Bhallaladeva orchestrated everything; Sivagami realizes too late. Baahubali dies forgiving Kattappa: Famous Telugu Dialogue: "Yedhi maranam? Aa marananni jayinchadaniki!" (English: "What is death? To conquer that death!"). Devasena gives birth to Mahendra amid chaos.
Sivagami's Sacrifice and Devasena's Imprisonment:
Sivagami declares infant Mahendra king and flees with him, but Bhallaladeva's forces attack. She holds him aloft in the river (opening scene loop), drowning while saving him. Bhallaladeva imprisons Devasena in chains for 25 years, where she builds a pyre vowing revenge.
Present-Day Rebellion and Siege:
Flashback ends. Mahendra rallies rebels, slaves, and Kattappa. They siege Mahishmati with innovative tactics: catapults, fire shields, and a massive tree battering ram. Mahendra storms the palace in epic fights.
Final Confrontation and Climax:
Mahendra battles Bhallaladeva in a brutal duel with maces, chariots, and flames. Mahendra chains Bhallaladeva to Devasena's pyre. Devasena lights it, burning him alive. Famous Telugu Dialogue (Devasena): "Ilanti kaanukala kosam memu vempara laadamu... Ivi anni naa kaali dhulitho samaanam!" (English: "For such gifts, we don't bow... All these are equal to the dust under my feet!").
Resolution and Coronation:
Mahendra is crowned king, marries Avantika, and restores justice. Devasena is freed. The film ends with peace in Mahishmati, emphasizing dharma over power. Famous Closing Dialogue (Mahendra): "Idi naa maata. Naa maate shasanam!" (English: "This is my word. My word is the law!").
This epic saga's twists—betrayals by family, manipulated oaths, and hidden identities—elevate it beyond action, making it a cultural phenomenon with themes of loyalty, motherhood, and heroism. The films grossed over ₹2,500 crore worldwide, revolutionizing Indian cinema with scale and storytelling
